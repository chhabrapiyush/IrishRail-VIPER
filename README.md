Subject: Clarification on App Downloads as a KPI

Dear Stakeholders,

While total app downloads are often referenced as a measure of adoption, I’d like to clarify why this metric alone is not an accurate indicator of meaningful engagement or client usage—especially in the context of our iOS app.

Key Points:
	1.	Downloads ≠ Active Clients:
App store download metrics count every install—regardless of whether the user is a client or a prospect. This includes individuals who may install the app out of curiosity, for research, or by mistake, and never engage with it meaningfully.
	2.	No Insight into Usage Patterns:
Downloads provide no visibility into user behavior post-install. A user might download the app, never log in, or uninstall it shortly after.
	3.	Better KPI: Active Devices / Users:
A more reliable metric would be the count of Daily Active Users (DAU) or Monthly Active Users (MAU), segmented by client and non-client (if identifiable). These can be captured from backend logs, which reflect actual authenticated sessions and usage on unique devices.
	4.	Actionable Insights:
Backend-derived metrics allow us to track user retention, feature adoption, engagement frequency, and churn—all of which are far more actionable from a product and engineering standpoint.

Recommendation:
Let’s shift focus from total downloads to backend-based metrics like MAU/DAU for decision-making and reporting. This ensures we’re aligning with user behavior and value delivery rather than just reach.

Happy to walk through our current tracking capabilities and how we can optimize these metrics moving forward.

Best regards,

Sure! Here’s a more casual, conversational version that still gets the point across clearly:

Hey team,

Just wanted to flag something about how we’re measuring adoption for the iOS app.

Right now, we’ve been looking at total app downloads, but that’s not really a great indicator of how many actual clients are using the app. Anyone can download it—whether they’re a client or not—so the number includes a lot of noise (e.g., prospects, testers, or people who never even log in).

A better way to measure real usage would be to look at Monthly Active Users (MAU) or Daily Active Users (DAU). We can pull this from backend logs, which track how many unique devices are logging in and actually using the app. That gives us a much cleaner and more accurate view of engagement.

Let me know if it makes sense to shift our focus toward these metrics instead—I’m happy to dive into the data or set something up to track this better.

Thanks!
